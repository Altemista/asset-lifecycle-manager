# Altemista Asset Lifecycle Manager

This project is a component of the *Altemista Asset Catalog*, an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes self-operated applications provided by our Asset Catalog.

AALM extends OLM to provide a declarative way to install, manage, and upgrade assets or applications managed by their Operators in a cluster.

It also enforces some constraints on the components it manages in order to ensure a good user experience.
